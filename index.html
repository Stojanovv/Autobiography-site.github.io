<div class="aboutme">
    <h1 id="about">About me</h1>
    <p>Hello! My name is Vasko Stojanov. I was born in Strumica, Macedonia. I'm a 20-year-old aspiring software developer with a passion for technology, gaming, and adventure. I've always been fascinated by how things work and enjoy creating solutions to everyday problems through coding.
        My early life was filled with joy, curiosity, and a bit of mischief.  I attended st.Ciril and Methodius Elementary School, where I discovered my love for computers. My parents, encouraged me to explore my interests, which led me to spend countless hours tinkering with gadgets and learning basic programming.
        High school was a transformative period for me. I attended Nikola Karev High School, where I joined the Computer Science Club and participated in various hackathons and coding competitions. These experiences not only honed my technical skills but also taught me the importance of teamwork and perseverance.
        Currently, I am a at the University of Ss. Cyril and Methodius University in Skopje (UKIM). College life is a whirlwind of new experiences, challenges, and growth. I've the opportunity to work on exciting projects, such as developing a mobile app for campus navigation and creating a website for a local non-profit organization. Balancing academics, part-time jobs, and extracurricular activities has  demanding, but it has also been incredibly rewarding.

    <p>Santorini! This is one of the most beautiful places I have ever visited. Santorini is a small, round archipelago of volcanic islands located in the southern Aegean Sea, about 200 km southeast of mainland Greece. It is also known by the name Thera</p>

        <p>Hobbies
            In my free time, I engage in a variety of hobbies that keep me both physically active and mentally stimulated. One of my favorite pastimes is playing handball. Ever since I picked up the sport in high school, it has been a great way to stay fit, build teamwork skills, and enjoy friendly competition. For four years I actively played handball with the team
            of Astraion in the Macedonian first league as well as one year in the Super League.</p>

        <p>Another passion of mine is working with computers. From an early age, I've been fascinated by technology and how it can be used to solve problems and create new possibilities.

Whether I'm coding a new project, gaming, or simply tinkering with hardware, working with computers is both a hobby and a learning experience that constantly keeps me engaged and inspired.

<div class="favoritefood">
    <h1 id="favoritefood">Favorite food</h1>
    <p>Food holds a special place in my life, and I have a few favorite dishes that always manage to bring me joy. One of them is traditional Macedonian cuisine, which reminds me of home and family gatherings. My top Macedonian dishes are tavče gravče and ajvar. Tavče gravče is a simple yet incredibly tasty dish made from beans, cooked with various spices, and often served as a main course or a side dish. Ajvar, on the other hand, is indispensable, especially when it is prepared in the autumn and enjoyed with warm bread and cheese.
        Besides Macedonian cuisine, I have a deep appreciation for Italian food, particularly pizza and pasta. My favorite is the classic Margherita, with its simple combination of tomato, mozzarella, and basil. As for pasta, I can never resist spaghetti carbonara – a straightforward dish made with eggs, pancetta, and Parmesan, which is always rich and creamy.</p>
